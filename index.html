					<p>This is the course webpage for the Lean learning group, a participant-led crash course in the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/">Lean programming language</a>, a functional programming language that can be used as a proof verification system. The course is running in Spring 2023 under the auspices of the <a href="https://www.glams.org/">Glasgow-Maxwell School</a>. Organizational and logistical support is being delivered by <a href="mailto:djordan@ed.ac.uk">David Jordan</a>, <a href="mailto:P.Kinnear@ed.ac.uk">Patrick Kinnear</a> and <a href="mailto:Adrian.Dona@ed.ac.uk">Adrián Doña Mateo</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>When:</b> Tuesdays 12:00 - 13:30.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Where:</b> Bayes 1.35, Bayes Centre, Edinburgh; location tbc in Glasgow; online on Zoom, details circulated by email.
					</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Chat:</b> we have a private chat stream for the course on the <a href="https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/">Lean Zulip server</a>. To join the chat, you should join this server, and send an email to Patrick to be added to the stream.

See <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/index.html">this page</a> for details, in particular the video tutorial linked at the start of the page explains the whole process. Please at least go through items 1 and 2a before the next class.</td>
