Anyone taking this course for a credit will need to complete a (group) project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deadline for choosing projects is on the **11th of March**.

## What is a project?

- A project can be a theorem you want to formalise:
    - This can be some theorem from a lecture/book you like.
    - This can be a theorem that already exists in `mathlib`. You can reinvent the wheel!
    - This can be something new you want to add to `mathlib`.
    - It can also be some result from your research.
> [!NOTE]
> In some cases, formalising the statement of a theorem can be enough.
- A project can also be a game that explains a topic in mathematics using Lean
    - This can be a topic in Analysis, Topology, Algebra, Graph theory, etc...
    - Check out the [template](https://github.com/hhu-adam/GameSkeleton).

## Logistics

- You are expected to join the GitHub Organisation `glams-lean-2024` by sending us your GitHub usernames
- Expected deadline is at the end of April
- You are expected to give a presentation afterwards
