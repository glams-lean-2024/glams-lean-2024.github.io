SSFM stands for Sporadic Seminars in Formalising Mathematics.

These seminar talks will be for anyone that wants to share any progress of their formalisation or for those who just want to show off something they have formalised.

Please go on Discord to request for a spot.

## Schedule

1. <b>6th of February, 2024</b> (before the session starts) <br><br>
   **Title.**<br>
   Improving my pen-and-paper proofs in introductory number theory using Lean<br><br>
   **Abstract.**<br>
   Join me in exploring the impact of Lean on my number theory pen-and-paper proofs. Discover the surprising transformations of my pen-and-paper proofs -- from clarity to rigour and conciseness -- as Lean scrutinised and enhanced my understanding.<br>
