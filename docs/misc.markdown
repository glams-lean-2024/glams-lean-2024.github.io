- [GlaMS Proferssional Skills Workshop](https://glams-professional-skills.github.io/website/). The latter half of our course will involve working in groups on Lean projects. To do this, we will use git and GitHub as our tools for collaboration. If you are not familiar with these, you should attend the relevant sessions of this workshop.

- For more resources to help you learn Lean, check out the [Lean community website](https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html). In particular, you might find the [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/) textbook or the [Natural Number Game](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/NNG4) useful.
