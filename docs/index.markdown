This is the course webpage for Formalising Mathematics in Lean, an introductory course on the [Lean programming language](https://leanprover-community.github.io/), a functional programming language that can be used as a proof verification system. The course is running in Spring 2024 under the auspices of the [Glasgow-Maxwell School (GlaMS)](https://www.glams.org/). The course team are [Adrián Doña Mateo](mailto:Adrian.Dona@ed.ac.uk), [Monica Abu Omar](mailto:m.abu-omar.1@research.gla.ac.uk), [Patrick Kinnear](mailto:P.Kinnear@ed.ac.uk) and [Simone Castellan](mailto:2585618c@student.gla.ac.uk).

- **SSFM** (Sporadic Seminars in Formalising Mathematics):

   To encourage one another to formalise, we will be holding sporadic seminars called Sporadic Seminars in Formalising Mathematics (SSFM). This can be online or in-person before/after each session.  
   See more on the Discord server under (#ssfm) and the SSFM page [here](/ssfm).

- **Credit**:

   For PhD students taking this course for credit[^2], you will need to complete a (group) project. See the project page [here](/projects) for more information.  
   But please speak to us <mark>before</mark> beginning your project, to discuss <mark>feasibility</mark> and <mark>credit-worthiness</mark>.
