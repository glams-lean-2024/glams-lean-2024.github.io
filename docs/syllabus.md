# Course description
Firstly, what is a proof assistant? What can a proof assistant do and what can it **not** do?

What a proof assistant **can** do:
1. A proof assistant can verify your proof;
2. A proof assistant can make your proof interactive (and so makes teaching/learning more engaging);
3. A proof assistant can help you focus on one goal at a time.

What a proof assistant **cannot** do:
1. It will not prove something for you without your help;
2. It's not a mathematician.

So, in this course we will be learning about the Lean proof assistant in general, and how to formalise and verify mathematical proofs.
